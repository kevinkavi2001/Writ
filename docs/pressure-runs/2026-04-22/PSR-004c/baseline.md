# PSR-004c baseline snapshot

Captured immediately before run.

## Master friction log

Path: `/home/lucio.saldivar/.claude/skills/writ/workflow-friction.log`
Line count: 6181

After the run, diff against this baseline to extract the events
attributable to the run (note: per the known scoping gap, sub-agent
sessions in the Magento project log to the Magento project's local
friction log, not this skill's log; only master / orchestrator events
land here).

## Hook state

- writ-postcompact.sh: directive rewritten per option (a) — leads with
  the blocked case, STOP language, forbidden framing, fresh-evidence
  contrast. See directive-snapshot.txt for the verbatim emitted text.
- writ-pre-write-dispatch.sh: stderr tee unchanged (Phase 4b).
- writ-sdd-review-order.sh, writ-subagent-start.sh,
  writ-subagent-stop.sh: stderr tee added in Phase 4c D1.

## Tests

`pytest tests/test_phase4c_postcompact_directive.py
       tests/test_phase4c_stderr_capture.py` reported 21 passed in
0.97s in the orchestrator session prior to snapshot. Cited inline
because per the active post-compact directive, stale recalled output
does not count as fresh evidence.

## Phase 4c commit gate

Phase 4c remains uncommitted per the explicit gate from the user:
ship only after PSR-004 passes. PSR-004c is the verification run.
