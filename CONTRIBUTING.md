# Contributing to Writ

Rules in the Writ knowledge graph are governed by a structured authoring process. This document defines the workflow for adding, editing, and deprecating rules in a multi-author environment.

## Adding a rule

1. Run `writ add` to enter the interactive authoring flow.

2. The tool runs these gate checks in order, refusing to continue on any hard failure:

   - **ID collision.** `check_id_collision` queries Neo4j for the proposed `rule_id`. If it already exists, the flow aborts with `RuleIdCollisionError` (use `writ edit` instead, or pick a new ID). This runs before schema validation so re-used IDs fail fast and `MERGE` cannot silently overwrite an existing node.

   - **Schema validation.** Pydantic check against `writ.graph.schema.Rule`. Malformed rules are rejected before any graph write.

   - **Redundancy.** Any existing rule with at least 0.95 cosine similarity is flagged. This is advisory: you may proceed, but consider whether the new rule adds distinct value.

   - **Novelty and specificity.** Covered by the redundancy threshold plus reviewer judgment on `trigger` specificity.

   - **Conflict.** `CONFLICTS_WITH` edges to the new rule are reported after edge creation.

3. After the gate passes, the tool runs the new rule's text through the retrieval pipeline and presents relationship suggestions: the top five similar rules, offered as candidates for `DEPENDS_ON`, `SUPPLEMENTS`, or `RELATED_TO` edges.

4. Accept or reject each suggested relationship. No edges are created automatically.

5. Submit a PR containing the `writ add` output and any edge decisions for review.

## Editing a rule

1. Run `writ edit <rule_id>` to load the current rule and modify fields.
2. The same validation, redundancy, and conflict checks run on the updated text.
3. Edits use `MERGE` (idempotent). Running the same edit twice produces no change.
4. Submit a PR with the edit for review.

## Deprecating a rule

1. Do not delete rules. Instead, create a `SUPERSEDES` edge from the replacement rule to the deprecated rule.
2. The deprecated rule remains in the graph for audit and historical reference.
3. Run `writ add` for the replacement rule, then create the `SUPERSEDES` edge when prompted.

## Resolving conflicts

`CONFLICTS_WITH` edges require human resolution. When two rules conflict:

1. Both rules remain in the graph with the `CONFLICTS_WITH` edge visible.
2. The conflict appears in `writ validate` output and the `/conflicts` API endpoint.
3. The domain owner for the conflicting rules is responsible for resolution: deprecate one rule via `SUPERSEDES`, amend one rule, or document the conflict as intentional (for example, domain-specific exceptions).
4. Automatic merge of conflicting rules is never performed.

## Review process

- All rule additions and edits require PR review.
- The PR should include the `writ add` or `writ edit` terminal output showing validation results, suggestions, and any warnings.
- The reviewer verifies that relationship decisions are reasonable and that redundancy or conflict warnings were addressed.
- Domain-specific rules should be reviewed by someone familiar with that domain.

## AI proposed rules

When an AI agent (typically Claude during a Work mode session) discovers a recurring pattern that does not yet have a rule, it can submit a candidate via `POST /propose`. These rules go through the same structural gate as human additions, plus a few extra constraints:

- Authority is force-set to `ai-provisional`. The proposer cannot bypass this.
- Confidence is force-set to `speculative`.
- If the rule is mandatory, it must declare a `mechanical_enforcement_path`. Otherwise it cannot be enforced and would just be advisory in disguise.

Use `writ review` to triage AI proposed rules:

- `writ review` (no argument) lists every rule with `authority = ai-provisional`.
- `writ review <rule_id>` shows full detail plus the origin context (the task description and query that triggered the proposal).
- `writ review <rule_id> --promote` moves the rule to `authority = ai-promoted` and `confidence = peer-reviewed`.
- `writ review <rule_id> --reject` deletes the rule from the graph.
- `writ review <rule_id> --downweight` pins confidence to `speculative`.
- `writ review --stats` prints counts grouped by authority.

Promotion is a deliberate human act. The system does not promote on its own; frequency tracking only changes the runtime ranking weight, not the stored authority.

## Monthly review

Run on the first Monday of each month. Goal: turn the friction log into actionable graduation, trim, and rubric-refinement decisions.

### Cadence

1. Capture the month's signal:

   ```bash
   writ analyze-friction --rule-effectiveness --since 30 --json > review-$(date +%Y-%m).json
   writ analyze-friction --skill-usage --since 60
   writ analyze-friction --playbook-compliance --since 30
   writ analyze-friction --graduation-candidates
   writ analyze-friction --trim-candidates --since 90
   writ analyze-friction --quality-judge-false-positives --since 30
   ```

2. Triage rule effectiveness:
   - Stick rate below 50 percent: trigger too broad, rationalization unaddressed, or rule wrong. File an issue or revise the rule.
   - Stick rate at 85 percent or higher with low rationalization: graduation candidate (Step 4).

3. Process trim candidates:
   - Rules with fewer than 5 activations in 90 days and 0 denials: deprecate or consolidate.
   - Skills with fewer than 2 loads in 60 days: deprecate.
   - Document the rationale on the issue.

4. Process graduation candidates:
   - Promote eligible rules to canonical tier in the graph.
   - Update authority and confidence fields via `writ edit`.

5. Refine quality judge rubrics:
   - Override rate above 25 percent on any rubric: the rubric is a false-positive generator. Edit the rubric prose in `.claude/hooks/writ-quality-judge.sh`.

6. File the review notes in `docs/monthly-reviews/YYYY-MM.md` (copy from `TEMPLATE.md`).

### Why monthly

Friction signal is noisy at the per-session level. A 30, 60, or 90 day rolling window smooths over pressure runs, one-off pressure tests, and individual exploratory sessions. Acting on a week of data tunes against noise; acting on a month of data tunes against signal.
