# Writ

**v1.0.1** | MIT-licensed | Authored by Lucio Saldivar

A Claude Code harness that gives every coding session two helpers: a fast librarian that picks the rules that fit the current task, and a process keeper that blocks risky writes until you have approved a plan and tests.

At the live 276-rule production corpus (post Phase 1-5 public-rulebook expansion), the librarian returns ranked results in **0.590 ms at the 95th percentile**. At the 10,000-rule synthetic scale, it still holds at 0.557 ms while reducing context tokens by **726 times** versus loading the whole rulebook every turn.

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for the v1.0.0 release notes and the full set of capabilities shipped.

## Install as a Claude Code plugin

Writ is published as a single-plugin marketplace in this repo. The installable shape described here is current as of v1.0.1.

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Docker (Neo4j runs in a container)
- `jq`, `curl`, `envsubst`

**Install**

```shell
claude plugin marketplace add infinri/Writ
claude plugin install writ@writ
```

**One-time bootstrap.** Creates the venv at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA:-$HOME/.cache/writ}/.venv`, brings up Neo4j, ingests the rule bible, and starts the FastAPI daemon:

```shell
bash $(claude plugin path writ)/scripts/bootstrap-plugin.sh
```

Restart Claude Code. Verify with:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8765/health
# {"status":"healthy"}
```

The plugin's hooks degrade gracefully until bootstrap completes. The SessionStart hook prints clear setup instructions on every fresh session where any prerequisite is missing, but the session itself is never blocked.

The standalone install path at `~/.claude/skills/writ/` remains supported; see "Quick start" below if you prefer that mode.

## The problem

Three things break when you give a coding agent a large rulebook the obvious way (paste it all into the prompt):

1. **Token cost grows with the rulebook, not the work.** At 80 rules: about 13,876 tokens of rule text every turn. At 10,000 rules: 1,174,142 tokens. Cache hit rates collapse, latency climbs, the bill scales with the rulebook.
2. **Relevance degrades.** A model handed every rule treats none of them as load bearing. Specific rules drown in generic ones.
3. **Workflow discipline has nowhere to live.** Static skill files can describe a process; they cannot enforce it. Telling the model to write tests first does not stop it from writing the implementation first.

## What Writ does about it

Two layers, sharing a Neo4j-backed knowledge graph:

**The knowledge layer (the librarian).** A FastAPI service on `localhost:8765` that runs a five-stage hybrid retrieval pipeline:

```
Query text
  Stage 1: Domain Filter            < 1 ms     domain-scoped corpus
  Stage 2: BM25 keyword (Tantivy)   < 2 ms     top 50 candidates
  Stage 3: ANN vector (hnswlib)     < 3 ms     top 10 candidates
  Stage 4: Graph traversal          < 3 ms     adjacency cache for DEPENDS_ON,
                                                 SUPPLEMENTS, CONFLICTS_WITH, ...
  Stage 5: Two-pass ranking         < 1 ms     reciprocal rank + context budget
                                              total p95 budget: 10 ms
```

Each retriever covers a blind spot the others have. BM25 catches exact keyword matches. Vectors catch paraphrase ("SQL" versus "database query"). Graph traversal catches rules that share neither but are causally related. The two-pass ranker fuses everything with severity, confidence, and graph-proximity weights.

**The enforcement layer (the process keeper).** 30 hook scripts under `.claude/hooks/`, all wired into Claude Code via `templates/settings.json`, a session state machine in `bin/lib/writ-session.py`, slash commands, and 6 sub-agent role files. The state machine owns mode, phase, and gate state; hooks are thin clients that delegate to it.

**Mandatory rules (the architectural invariant).** Rules with `mandatory: true` (30 in the live corpus, spanning ENF-* enforcement rules and SEC-*/PERF-*/SCALE-* invariants from the public rulebook) are excluded from the retrieval pipeline at index build time. They are loaded out of band by hooks with their own 5,000 token budget cap. No change to ranking weights, embedding model, BM25 tuning, or graph traversal can cause an enforcement rule to disappear from agent context.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <writ-repo> ~/.claude/skills/writ
cd ~/.claude/skills/writ
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

The bootstrap script handles everything: prerequisite checks (Python 3.11+, Docker, git, envsubst), virtualenv, dependency install, harness config rendered into `~/.claude/`, rule and agent symlinks, Neo4j container via Docker Compose, rule corpus ingestion, and Writ daemon startup. Idempotent.

Verify:

```bash
writ status
# {"status":"healthy","rule_count":276,"mandatory_count":30,"index_state":"warm",...}

writ query "controller contains SQL query"
# Mode: full | Candidates: 14 | Latency: 0.3ms
# 1. [0.984] SEC-INJ-SQL-001  Parameterized queries only...
```

Open Claude Code in any project. Type a prompt. You should see a `[Writ: ...]` status line and a `--- WRIT RULES ---` block with the rules that apply to what you are doing.

## What you experience

When Claude is doing read-only work (asking questions, debugging, reviewing), Writ injects relevant rules and stays out of the way. When Claude is in Work mode and tries to write code before you have approved a plan, the write is denied with a clear reason like:

```
[ENF-GATE-PLAN] Write blocked. Approve plan.md first.
```

You write the plan, you say "approved," the gate opens. The next gate (test skeletons) blocks code that has no tests pointing at it. Same pattern: write the tests, approve, gate opens. After both gates clear, Claude writes the implementation freely.

Approval cannot be self-served. The slash command `/writ-approve` requires a one-time token written to `/tmp/writ-gate-token-${SESSION_ID}` only when the user actually types an approval phrase. If Claude tries to advance the gate via raw bash, the token is missing and the call is denied (logged as `agent_self_approval_blocked`).

## The mode system

| Mode         | Purpose                                            | Code generation |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Conversation | Discussion, brainstorming, questions               | No               |
| Debug        | Investigating a specific problem (read only)       | No               |
| Review       | Evaluating code against rules (read only)          | No               |
| Work         | Building or modifying code                         | Yes (with gates) |

In Work mode, two gates apply:
1. **`phase-a`** validates `plan.md` against four required sections (`## Files`, `## Analysis`, `## Rules Applied`, `## Capabilities`) and verifies every cited rule ID against rules actually loaded in the session.
2. **`test-skeletons`** requires at least one test file with real assertions before production code is written.

## Performance

Live system measurement (2026-05-10, 276 rule production corpus post Phase 1-5 public-rulebook expansion, ONNX runtime, warm indexes; 500 samples per stage on 10 representative queries):

| Stage             | Median   | p95      | Budget  | Headroom at p95 |
|-------------------|---------:|---------:|--------:|----------------:|
| End to end        | 0.338 ms | 0.590 ms | 10.0 ms | 17x             |

Cold start (median of 3 runs): 1.72 s (pre-expansion baseline; rebuild cost scales with corpus size).

Synthetic scale curve (2026-04-13, from `SCALE_BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md`):

| Corpus     | E2E p95   | Tokens stuffed | Tokens retrieved | Reduction |
|------------|----------:|---------------:|-----------------:|----------:|
| 80 rules   | 0.278 ms  | 13,876         | 3,155            | 4.4x      |
| 500 rules  | 0.359 ms  | 63,003         | 1,600            | 39.4x     |
| 1,000 rules| 0.399 ms  | 121,473        | 1,602            | 75.8x     |
| 10,000 rules| 0.557 ms | 1,174,142      | 1,617            | **726.1x**|

Quality (against the Phase 6 ground-truth corpus, 165 queries: the original 83 + 82 new queries covering the public-rulebook expansion):

| Metric                                            | Threshold | Actual         |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| MRR at 5 (ambiguous queries, n=19)                | >= 0.45   | 0.4886         |
| Hit rate (all 165 queries)                        | >= 0.75   | 0.7636         |
| Methodology MRR at 5 (n=40, signed off corpus)    | >= 0.78   | 0.8583         |
| Methodology hit rate                              | >= 0.90   | 1.0000         |
| ONNX vs PyTorch ranking stability                 | identical | 0/83 differ    |

The ambiguous-set MRR and hit-rate floors were retuned downward during the Phase 1-5 expansion: the corpus grew 3.8x (72 to 276 rules) while the ambiguous-set query count remained constant at 19. Methodology retrieval is unaffected (a separate, signed-off corpus).

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and fixes:

- **`Docker daemon not reachable`**: start Docker Desktop, or `sudo systemctl start docker` on Linux, then re-run `bootstrap.sh`.
- **`python3 version is 3.9; need >= 3.11`**: install a newer Python. `pyenv` is a clean way to manage versions without touching system Python.
- **`port 7687 already in use`**: another Neo4j instance is running. Either stop it (`docker stop <container>`) or change the `ports:` mapping in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **`Neo4j did not become reachable within 60s`**: check logs (`docker compose logs neo4j`). Common cause: insufficient memory allocated to Docker Desktop (Neo4j needs ~1 GB).
- **`daemon did not become healthy within 10s`**: check `/tmp/writ-server.log`. Usually an import error; re-run `pip install -e .` from the skill directory with the venv activated.
- **Default Neo4j credentials (`neo4j/writdevpass`)**: a development default. For any non-local use, change `NEO4J_AUTH` in `docker-compose.yml` and the matching `[neo4j]` section in `writ.toml`.

Errors come back as HTTP 200 with `{"error": "..."}` for logical failures, 422 for Pydantic validation, 5xx for unhandled DB exceptions. Clients should check the `error` key, not just status codes.

## Configuration

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `writ.toml` | Service configuration: Neo4j credentials, ranking weights, embedding model, context budgets, gate thresholds. |
| `pyproject.toml` | Package metadata. Production deps: fastapi, uvicorn, neo4j, tantivy, sentence-transformers, hnswlib, pydantic, typer, rich, httpx. Entry point: `writ = "writ.cli:app"`. |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Plugin manifest. `defaultEnabled: true`. Lifecycle Init invokes `scripts/ensure-server.sh`; Shutdown invokes `scripts/stop-server.sh`. |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Single `neo4j:5` service on ports 7474 and 7687, health-checked via cypher-shell. |
| `templates/settings.json` | Canonical hook wiring (30 hooks). |
| `bin/lib/checklists.json` | Phase exit criteria. |
| `bin/lib/gate-categories.json` | File classification glob patterns plus framework detection. |
| `writ/shared/budget.json` | Single source of truth for budget constants (default 8000, summary cost 40, standard 120, full 200, always_on_cap 5000). |

Environment variables read by hooks: `WRIT_HOST` (default `localhost`), `WRIT_PORT` (default `8765`), `WRIT_CACHE_DIR` (default `tempfile.gettempdir()`), `WRIT_FRICTION_LOG`, `WRIT_HOOK_LOG`, `WRIT_DEBUG_LOG`. Neo4j credentials are read from `writ.toml` only; there is no `WRIT_NEO4J_*` override.

## Testing

90 test files, 1,192 test functions. The end-of-suite hook in `tests/conftest.py` shells out to `scripts/migrate.py --methodology-dir bible/methodology` to restore the production graph after tests run.

```bash
make test          # pytest tests/ -x -q
make bench         # pytest benchmarks/bench_targets.py -x -q
make check         # both
```

Pre-commit: `make bench` runs at `pre-push`. No formatting or lint hooks configured.

The benchmark suite has four files:
- `benchmarks/bench_targets.py` (12 contractual targets, all pass/fail).
- `benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py` (Neo4j traversal scale at 1K and 10K nodes; wipes the graph).
- `benchmarks/scale_benchmark.py` (the synthetic 80/500/1K/10K scale curve generator; restores only Rule nodes).
- `benchmarks/methodology_bench.py` (methodology retrieval against the curated 40-query Phase 0 corpus; read only, no Neo4j changes).

## Status

**Released as v1.0.0 on 2026-05-10.** All five retrieval stages with budget headroom at every level. Mode and gate enforcement. AI rule proposal with the 5-check structural gate. Frequency-driven graduation logic. Sub-agent isolation (`is_subagent`) and orchestrator suppression (`is_orchestrator`). ONNX-optimized embedding inference verified identical to PyTorch on every test query. HNSW persistence with corpus-hash invalidation. 1,441 tests. Friction log analytics with a dashboard.

**Public out-of-the-box rulebook seeded.** 198 new universal rules across Security, Clean Code, DRY, SOLID, Architecture, Testing, Error Handling, Performance, Scaling, API Design, Process, and Documentation, plus 19 new mandatory rules each backed by a cross-language regex analyzer in `bin/run-analysis.sh`. See `out-of-the-box-rules.md` for the canonical rule list.

## Switching from the standalone install to the plugin

The standalone install at `~/.claude/skills/writ/` keeps working in v1.0.1; the plugin path is purely additive. If you'd rather move to the plugin path:

1. Stop the existing daemon: `bash ~/.claude/skills/writ/scripts/stop-server.sh`
2. Remove the symlinks the standalone bootstrap created: `rm -f ~/.claude/rules/writ-*.md ~/.claude/agents/writ-*.md`
3. Remove the rendered hook block from `~/.claude/settings.json` (the `permissions.allow` and `hooks` sections that reference `$HOME/.claude/skills/writ/.claude/hooks/`). Back up the file first.
4. Install the plugin as described in "Install as a Claude Code plugin" above. The Neo4j Docker volume (`writ-neo4j-data`) is shared between modes, so the rule corpus survives the switch.

The standalone-skill checkout itself can stay on disk; nothing in the plugin install path looks at it.
