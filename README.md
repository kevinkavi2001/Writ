# Writ

A Claude Code harness that gives every coding session two helpers: a fast librarian that picks the rules that fit the current task, and a process keeper that blocks risky writes until you have approved a plan and tests.

At the live 73-rule production corpus, the librarian returns ranked results in **0.435 ms at the 95th percentile**. At the 10,000-rule synthetic scale, it still holds at 0.557 ms while reducing context tokens by **726 times** versus loading the whole rulebook every turn.

## The problem

Three things break when you give a coding agent a large rulebook the obvious way (paste it all into the prompt):

1. **Token cost grows with the rulebook, not the work.** At 80 rules: about 13,876 tokens of rule text every turn. At 10,000 rules: 1,174,142 tokens. Cache hit rates collapse, latency climbs, the bill scales with the rulebook.
2. **Relevance degrades.** A model handed every rule treats none of them as load bearing. Specific rules drown in generic ones.
3. **Workflow discipline has nowhere to live.** Static skill files can describe a process; they cannot enforce it. Telling the model to write tests first does not stop it from writing the implementation first.

## What Writ does about it

Two layers, sharing a Neo4j-backed knowledge graph:

**The knowledge layer (the librarian).** A FastAPI service on `localhost:8765` that runs a five-stage hybrid retrieval pipeline:

```
Query text
  Stage 1: Domain Filter            < 1 ms     domain-scoped corpus
  Stage 2: BM25 keyword (Tantivy)   < 2 ms     top 50 candidates
  Stage 3: ANN vector (hnswlib)     < 3 ms     top 10 candidates
  Stage 4: Graph traversal          < 3 ms     adjacency cache for DEPENDS_ON,
                                                 SUPPLEMENTS, CONFLICTS_WITH, ...
  Stage 5: Two-pass ranking         < 1 ms     reciprocal rank + context budget
                                              total p95 budget: 10 ms
```

Each retriever covers a blind spot the others have. BM25 catches exact keyword matches. Vectors catch paraphrase ("SQL" versus "database query"). Graph traversal catches rules that share neither but are causally related. The two-pass ranker fuses everything with severity, confidence, and graph-proximity weights.

**The enforcement layer (the process keeper).** 30 hook scripts under `.claude/hooks/`, all wired into Claude Code via `templates/settings.json`, a session state machine in `bin/lib/writ-session.py`, slash commands, and 6 sub-agent role files. The state machine owns mode, phase, and gate state; hooks are thin clients that delegate to it.

**Mandatory rules (the architectural invariant).** Rules with `mandatory: true` (all 41 of them carry the `ENF-` prefix in the live corpus) are excluded from the retrieval pipeline at index build time. They are loaded out of band by hooks with their own 5,000 token budget cap. No change to ranking weights, embedding model, BM25 tuning, or graph traversal can cause an enforcement rule to disappear from agent context.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <writ-repo> ~/.claude/skills/writ
cd ~/.claude/skills/writ
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

The bootstrap script handles everything: prerequisite checks (Python 3.11+, Docker, git, envsubst), virtualenv, dependency install, harness config rendered into `~/.claude/`, rule and agent symlinks, Neo4j container via Docker Compose, rule corpus ingestion, and Writ daemon startup. Idempotent.

Verify:

```bash
writ status
# {"status":"healthy","rule_count":90,"mandatory_count":41,"index_state":"warm",...}

writ query "controller contains SQL query"
# Mode: full | Candidates: 14 | Latency: 0.3ms
# 1. [0.984] DB-SQL-001  Controllers must not embed SQL...
```

Open Claude Code in any project. Type a prompt. You should see a `[Writ: ...]` status line and a `--- WRIT RULES ---` block with the rules that apply to what you are doing.

## What you experience

When Claude is doing read-only work (asking questions, debugging, reviewing), Writ injects relevant rules and stays out of the way. When Claude is in Work mode and tries to write code before you have approved a plan, the write is denied with a clear reason like:

```
[ENF-GATE-PLAN] Write blocked. Approve plan.md first.
```

You write the plan, you say "approved," the gate opens. The next gate (test skeletons) blocks code that has no tests pointing at it. Same pattern: write the tests, approve, gate opens. After both gates clear, Claude writes the implementation freely.

Approval cannot be self-served. The slash command `/writ-approve` requires a one-time token written to `/tmp/writ-gate-token-${SESSION_ID}` only when the user actually types an approval phrase. If Claude tries to advance the gate via raw bash, the token is missing and the call is denied (logged as `agent_self_approval_blocked`).

## The mode system

| Mode         | Purpose                                            | Code generation |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Conversation | Discussion, brainstorming, questions               | No               |
| Debug        | Investigating a specific problem (read only)       | No               |
| Review       | Evaluating code against rules (read only)          | No               |
| Work         | Building or modifying code                         | Yes (with gates) |

In Work mode, two gates apply:
1. **`phase-a`** validates `plan.md` against four required sections (`## Files`, `## Analysis`, `## Rules Applied`, `## Capabilities`) and verifies every cited rule ID against rules actually loaded in the session.
2. **`test-skeletons`** requires at least one test file with real assertions before production code is written.

## Configuration

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `writ.toml` | Service configuration: Neo4j credentials, ranking weights, embedding model, context budgets, gate thresholds. |
| `pyproject.toml` | Package metadata. Production deps: fastapi, uvicorn, neo4j, tantivy, sentence-transformers, hnswlib, pydantic, typer, rich, httpx. Entry point: `writ = "writ.cli:app"`. |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Plugin manifest. `defaultEnabled: true`. Lifecycle Init invokes `scripts/ensure-server.sh`; Shutdown invokes `scripts/stop-server.sh`. |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Single `neo4j:5` service on ports 7474 and 7687, health-checked via cypher-shell. |
| `templates/settings.json` | Canonical hook wiring (30 hooks). |
| `bin/lib/checklists.json` | Phase exit criteria. |
| `bin/lib/gate-categories.json` | File classification glob patterns plus framework detection. |
| `writ/shared/budget.json` | Single source of truth for budget constants (default 8000, summary cost 40, standard 120, full 200, always_on_cap 5000). |

Environment variables read by hooks: `WRIT_HOST` (default `localhost`), `WRIT_PORT` (default `8765`), `WRIT_CACHE_DIR` (default `tempfile.gettempdir()`), `WRIT_FRICTION_LOG`, `WRIT_HOOK_LOG`, `WRIT_DEBUG_LOG`. Neo4j credentials are read from `writ.toml` only; there is no `WRIT_NEO4J_*` override.

## Testing

90 test files, 1,192 test functions. The end-of-suite hook in `tests/conftest.py` shells out to `scripts/migrate.py --methodology-dir bible/methodology` to restore the production graph after tests run.

```bash
make test          # pytest tests/ -x -q
make bench         # pytest benchmarks/bench_targets.py -x -q
make check         # both
```

Pre-commit: `make bench` runs at `pre-push`. No formatting or lint hooks configured.

The benchmark suite has four files:
- `benchmarks/bench_targets.py` (12 contractual targets, all pass/fail).
- `benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py` (Neo4j traversal scale at 1K and 10K nodes; wipes the graph).
- `benchmarks/scale_benchmark.py` (the synthetic 80/500/1K/10K scale curve generator; restores only Rule nodes).
- `benchmarks/methodology_bench.py` (methodology retrieval against the curated 40-query Phase 0 corpus; read only, no Neo4j changes).

## Status

**Production ready.** All five retrieval stages with budget headroom at every level. Mode and gate enforcement. AI rule proposal with the 5-check structural gate. Frequency-driven graduation logic. Sub-agent isolation (`is_subagent`) and orchestrator suppression (`is_orchestrator`). ONNX-optimized embedding inference verified identical to PyTorch on every test query. HNSW persistence with corpus-hash invalidation. 90 test files. Friction log analytics with a dashboard.

**Mandatory rule cleanup (2026-05-10).** The pre-cleanup graph had 41 mandatory rules; the audit (`docs/mandatory-rule-audit.md`, 2026-04-21) recommended 18 of those for demotion because no mechanical enforcement path was viable. The 2026-05-10 cleanup went further: it deleted 17 rules tied to the dead Phase A-D / Tier-0-3 / completion-matrix workflow (rules whose principles were either duplicated by current hooks or whose enforcement mechanism no longer exists), demoted another 12 to advisory (sound principles with no automated check), and left 11 mandatory rules, every one of which now points at a real, verified mechanical enforcement path in the v2 system.

**Documented but inert.** A handful of features are implemented but not yet wired into the runtime path:
- Abstraction summary mode is built (`writ/compression/`) but `pipeline.query()` does not pass abstractions into the budget trimmer.
- The `compute_confidence_weight` graduation read-time override is callable but not invoked from `query()`.
- 7 of the 17 allowed edge types lack rules using them (`DEPENDS_ON`, `CONFLICTS_WITH`, `SUPPLEMENTS`, `SUPERSEDES`, `APPLIES_TO`, `ABSTRACTS`, `JUSTIFIED_BY`).
- `Abstraction.abstraction_id` lacks a uniqueness constraint despite `MERGE`-based creation.

**Documentation drift to clean up.** Older handbook claims are tracked against the live code:
- The graduation logic uses a plain ratio threshold (`positive / n >= 0.75` at `n >= 50`), not a Wilson confidence interval. The Wilson reasoning is the justification for `n = 50`, not the runtime check.
- The `normalize_ranks` docstring says "reciprocal rank fusion." The implementation is plain reciprocal rank `1 / (rank + 1)`, no `k` constant.
- A comment in `writ/compression/clusters.py` says "cosine distance" where the formula is Euclidean. Behavior is identical because embeddings are L2-normalized, but the comment is wrong.
