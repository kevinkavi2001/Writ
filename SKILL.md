  Claude Code harness with two co-equal layers: a hybrid-RAG knowledge service
  that retrieves the coding rules an AI agent needs for the current task in well
  under a millisecond, plus a session-aware enforcement layer that blocks risky
  writes until the user has approved a plan and tests. The knowledge service runs
  a five-stage pipeline (domain filter, BM25 keyword via Tantivy, ANN vector via
  hnswlib, graph traversal via a pre-computed adjacency cache, and weighted
  ranking) over a Neo4j-backed knowledge graph. The enforcement layer is wired
  into Claude Code via 30 hook scripts and a session state machine. Activates on
  every software engineering task: code generation, code review, design,
  research, auditing, debugging, testing, planning, and architecture decisions.
  The knowledge base is always queried; task complexity only determines the
  level of ceremony, not whether Writ activates.

# Writ: Hybrid RAG knowledge retrieval plus workflow enforcement

## Two layers, one harness

Writ is the full Claude Code harness in this repository. It is not a single service. The repository composes three things:

**Knowledge layer (the librarian).** A stateless FastAPI service on `localhost:8765` that answers "what rules apply to this context?" via a five-stage retrieval pipeline (BM25 plus vector plus graph traversal plus reciprocal rank fusion plus context budget). Rules are facts; they do not change based on workflow state.

**Enforcement layer (the process keeper).** A session-aware workflow engine made of 30 hook scripts under `.claude/hooks/`, a state machine in `bin/lib/writ-session.py` (about 2,000 lines), slash commands under `.claude/commands/`, and 6 sub-agent role files under `.claude/agents/`. Owns mode state, phase state, gate criteria, file classification, and the audit trail. Hooks are thin clients that delegate decisions to the state machine.

**Canonical store (Neo4j).** Holds the rulebook itself: every rule, every methodology node, every relationship between them. The librarian builds its in-memory indexes from Neo4j when the service starts and serves queries from those indexes. Neo4j is the source of truth. The `bible/` directory is a human-readable Markdown export, not a runtime data source.

## How rules reach you

Rules are injected automatically by `writ-rag-inject.sh` on every user turn:

1. Takes the user's prompt as a natural language query (or a keyword extract for long prompts).
2. Reads the session cache for mode, current phase, loaded rule IDs, and remaining token budget.
3. POSTs to `http://localhost:8765/query` with `{query, exclude_rule_ids, prefer_rule_ids, budget_tokens}`.
4. Writ's pipeline ranks rules by relevance using the live indexes built from Neo4j.
5. Returns rules formatted as a `--- WRIT RULES ---` block in your context.

If no rules appear, either the server is down (you will see a warning), the prompt was too short (under 10 characters), the budget was exhausted, or the context is over 75 percent full.

Rules are phase-aware: only current-phase rule IDs are excluded from re-injection. When a phase advances, previously loaded rules can be re-injected for the new phase.

## What the rules look like

```
--- WRIT RULES (N rules, <mode> mode) ---

[RULE-ID] (severity, authority, domain) score=N.NNN
WHEN: trigger condition
RULE: what must be done
VIOLATION: example of doing it wrong
CORRECT: example of doing it right

--- END WRIT RULES ---
```

## Rule authority

- **human.** Highest trust, manually authored.
- **ai-promoted.** AI-proposed, then promoted by a human reviewer via `writ review --promote`. Confidence is bumped to `peer-reviewed`.
- **ai-provisional.** AI-proposed, not yet reviewed. Lowest trust, capped at `confidence: speculative`.

Human rules outrank AI rules at equal relevance (a hard preference, not a weight, configured via `authority_preference_threshold`).

## Mode system

Every session operates in one of four modes. The mode determines workflow ceremony, RAG strategy, and whether code generation is allowed. All modes receive rule injection.

| Mode         | Purpose                                  | Gates                       | Code generation |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|
| Conversation | Discussion, brainstorming, questions     | None                        | No               |
| Debug        | Investigating a problem                  | None                        | No               |
| Review       | Evaluating code against rules            | None                        | No               |
| Work         | Building or modifying code               | phase-a plus test-skeletons | Yes              |

No mode declared means all writes are blocked except `plan.md`.

Set the mode via the `mode set` subcommand of `bin/lib/writ-session.py`. The RAG inject hook prints the exact command with paths filled in. Legacy `tier set [0-3]` commands are recognized by `inject-tier-workflow.sh` for backward compatibility (tier 0 maps to conversation, tiers 1, 2, 3 map to work).

## Gate enforcement

`bin/lib/writ-session.py` is the sole authority on phase state:

- **can-write.** Decides whether a file write is allowed. Reads the tool input envelope, classifies the file against `gate-categories.json`, checks the session's approved gates. Returns allow or deny. Hooks that need to make this decision delegate to this function.

- **advance-phase.** Validates artifacts (plan.md sections, test files), records the phase transition in the audit trail, creates a gate file. Requires a one-time token written by `auto-approve-gate.sh` only when the user actually types an approval phrase. Self-approval by the agent via raw bash is denied with `agent_self_approval_blocked`.

- **current-phase.** Returns the authoritative current phase from session state.

Gate files at `.claude/gates/*.approved` are artifacts created by `advance-phase`. They contain the session ID. Stale gates from previous sessions are rejected.

### Gate criteria (what the validator checks)

**phase-a (plan gate).** Work mode. Requires `plan.md` with sections `## Files`, `## Analysis`, `## Rules Applied` (rule IDs cited must match rules actually loaded in the session, no hallucinated IDs), and `## Capabilities` (checkboxes). The ExitPlanMode hook validates the format automatically.

**test-skeletons (test gate).** Work mode. Requires at least one test file with a recognizable test method signature and real assertions.

## Session management

`bin/lib/writ-session.py` manages per-session state in temporary files under `${WRIT_CACHE_DIR}` (default `tempfile.gettempdir()`):

- **Mode** (conversation, debug, review, work).
- **Current phase** (planning, testing, implementation, complete; Work mode only).
- **Gates approved** (source of truth, not inferred from disk).
- **Loaded rule IDs by phase** (for exclude-list scoping).
- **Phase transitions** (audit trail with timestamps and triggers).
- **Token budget** (starts at 8,000, decrements per query).
- **Always-on budget** (separate cap of 5,000 tokens for mandatory rules).
- **Context pressure** (skips RAG queries when context is over 75 percent).
- **Analysis results** (per-file pass or fail from static analysis).
- **Pending violations** (rule violations awaiting phase-boundary routing).
- **Invalidation history** (gate invalidation records for escalation detection).

## Hook inventory

Writ ships 30 hook scripts under `.claude/hooks/`, all wired into Claude Code via `templates/settings.json`. (Three legacy hooks tied to the deprecated Phase A-D / completion-matrix gate workflow were removed on 2026-05-10: `check-gate-approval.sh`, `enforce-final-gate.sh`, and `writ-pretool-rag.sh`.)

| `writ-subagent-stop.sh`       | SubagentStop                   | Records subagent rollup metrics |

## Sub-agents

Workers spawned from an orchestrator get an isolated session cache keyed on `agent_id`, with their own 8,000 token RAG budget and `is_subagent: true` set. Workers bypass mode and gate checks entirely (the orchestrator already cleared the human-approval flow). PostToolUse RAG still fires inside workers so they get rule injection on every file write.

The orchestrator master sets Work mode with the `--orchestrator` flag, which sets `is_orchestrator: true`. That flag tells `writ-rag-inject.sh` to suppress the broad rule injection on every UserPromptSubmit and emit a compact status line instead. The orchestrator does not need rule guidance turn by turn; the workers do.

## Supported languages and frameworks

Gate categories support: PHP, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, GraphQL, XML. Framework-specific patterns: Magento 2, Django, Rails, Spring, NestJS, Express, Laravel. Add new patterns via `bin/lib/gate-categories.json`.

Static analysis routes by file extension: PHPStan, ESLint, ruff, xmllint, cargo check, go vet. Add new analyzers via `bin/run-analysis.sh`.

## Proposing new rules

Propose a rule when any of these occur:

1. **Bug fix reveals a missing guard.** You fixed a bug that a rule should have prevented. Propose for the root cause pattern, not the symptom.
2. **Architectural decision with no prior art.** You made a design choice with no matching rule in the injected set, and it would benefit future tasks.
3. **User corrects your approach.** The user says "do not do X" or "always do Y" and no injected rule covers it.
4. **Framework or library gotcha.** A non-obvious constraint that would trap future agents.

Do not propose for: one-off project decisions (use project memory instead), obvious language usage, or duplicates of already-injected rules.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/propose -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "rule_id": "DOMAIN-CATEGORY-NNN",
  "domain": "architecture",
  "severity": "medium",
  "scope": "function",
  "trigger": "when this situation occurs",
  "statement": "what must be done",
  "violation": "example of doing it wrong",
  "pass_example": "example of doing it right",
  "enforcement": "how to verify compliance",
  "rationale": "why this matters",
  "last_validated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "task_description": "what you were doing when you discovered this",
  "query_that_triggered": "the prompt that led here"
}'
```

Rule ID convention: `{DOMAIN}-{CATEGORY}-{NNN}` where DOMAIN is a broad area (ARCH, PY, PHP, FW, DB, TEST, PERF, SEC, ENF, OPS). Check existing rules to avoid ID collisions.

Proposed rules enter as `ai-provisional` with `confidence: speculative` and must pass the structural gate (schema, mechanical-enforcement-path for mandatory rules, specificity, redundancy, novelty, conflict checks).

### Recording feedback

When a rule directly influenced your implementation (you followed it, or it prevented an error), record positive feedback:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/feedback -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"rule_id": "RULE-ID-HERE", "signal": "positive"}'
```

Negative feedback (rule was present but did not prevent an error) is recorded automatically by the enforcement hooks at phase boundaries.

## Server requirements

Writ requires:
- Neo4j at `bolt://localhost:7687` (credentials in `writ.toml` or `docker-compose.yml`).
- Writ server: `writ serve` (default `localhost:8765`).
- Bible rules imported: `writ import-markdown` (initial bootstrap only).
- Hooks installed: `bash scripts/install-harness-config.sh`.

When loaded as a plugin, `scripts/ensure-server.sh` starts Neo4j (Docker) and the Writ server automatically via the Init lifecycle hook.
