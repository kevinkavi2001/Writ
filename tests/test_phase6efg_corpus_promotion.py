"""Phase 6e/6f/6g: methodology corpus promotion to bible/methodology/.

The 60-file methodology corpus moved from
`tests/fixtures/synthetic_methodology/` to `bible/methodology/` in
this commit. Migration runs against the new location to populate
Neo4j with Skill / Playbook / Technique / AntiPattern / Role /
ForbiddenResponse / Phase / Rationalization / PressureScenario /
WorkedExample / SubagentRole nodes.

Tests verify:
  1. The new location exists with the expected per-type file counts.
  2. The old location is gone (catches incomplete moves).
  3. Each major node-type prefix is represented.
  4. The corpus parses cleanly via the existing methodology loader
     (no parser regression introduced by the path change).
  5. The Phase 6 master plan reflects 6e/6f/6g as shipped (doc
     update coupled to the code change).

Migration smoke (running the migrate script + asserting against the
live Neo4j) is verified out-of-band via curl /health, not in this
test suite, because integration tests against a running daemon
belong with the integration harness, not unit pytest.
