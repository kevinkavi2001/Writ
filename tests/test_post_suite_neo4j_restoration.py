"""End-of-suite Neo4j restoration: methodology corpus must be present
after pytest finishes.

Context: 9 test modules call `db.clear_all()`. Only `test_retrieval`
restored via migrate.py in its module teardown. The pre-existing
`pytest_sessionfinish` hook in tests/conftest.py was supposed to be
the safety net but its `if count == 0` gate skipped re-migration
whenever ANY test re-loaded core rules (most do), leaving methodology
nodes (Skill / Playbook / etc.) missing post-suite.

Symptom: `/always-on?mode=work` returned empty after `pytest -q`
because the methodology corpus had been wiped and never restored.

This test pins the new contract: after pytest_sessionfinish runs,
Skill nodes are in Neo4j (a methodology marker, since core Rule
re-loads can leave that label empty).
