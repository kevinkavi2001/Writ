"""PSR-008 Finding 1: methodology companion must fire in orchestrator mode.

Context: PSR-008 surfaced 0 events with `query_source: "methodology"` despite
the agent running in Work mode. Root cause: writ-rag-inject.sh's orchestrator
short-circuit (`exit 0` at the IS_ORCHESTRATOR=true branch) bypasses the
methodology companion block entirely.

Fix contract (this test pins): when a session has both `mode=work` AND
`is_orchestrator=true`, the inject hook MUST still fire the methodology
companion query before short-circuiting. The status-line output and the
`exit 0` are preserved -- only the methodology block runs additionally.

This is checked structurally (the orchestrator branch of the hook source
references the methodology query) AND end-to-end (running the hook against
a seeded orchestrator cache produces a `query_source: "methodology"` line
in the friction log).
