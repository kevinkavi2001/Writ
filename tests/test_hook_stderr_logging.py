"""Hook stderr surfacing -- replace 2>/dev/null with $WRIT_HOOK_LOG.

Context: the legacy-cache KeyError went undetected for an entire session
because writ-rag-inject.sh and writ-posttool-rag.sh swallowed stderr from
the mutating `_writ_session update` calls. These tests pin the new
contract: stderr from those calls must reach a hook log file, not /dev/null.

We can't easily test the bash redirection itself, so we test the
underlying capability: WRIT_HOOK_LOG exists as a documented contract via a
helper, and the hook scripts reference it instead of /dev/null on the
mutating call sites.
