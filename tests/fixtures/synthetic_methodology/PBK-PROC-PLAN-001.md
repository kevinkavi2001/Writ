trigger: "When an approved design is ready to be decomposed into a concrete implementation plan."
statement: "Map the file structure, decompose into bite-sized tasks with complete code per step, integrate TDD per task, self-review the plan before presenting."
rationale: "A single-pass plan that maps structure before decomposing produces coherent, task-level-reproducible artifacts. Iterating in the middle of writing the plan produces inconsistency."

# Playbook: Write a plan

## Order of operations

1. Map file structure — which files will be touched, created, deleted.
2. Decompose — break work into bite-sized tasks.
3. Per task: exact paths, complete code, test first (TDD integrated).
4. Self-review — placeholder scan, spec coverage, type consistency, contradictions.
5. Present.

## No placeholders

See `SKL-PROC-PLAN-001` for the blocklist.
