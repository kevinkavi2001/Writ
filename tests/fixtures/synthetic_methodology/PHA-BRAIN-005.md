node_type: Phase
domain: process
scope: session
trigger: "Fifth phase of PBK-PROC-BRAIN-001. Fires when the design has spatial/visual/layout elements after trade-offs are named."
statement: "If the design has visual elements (UI, layout, state machines, data flows), offer a visual companion artifact in a separate message. Do not bundle the offer with clarifying questions."
rationale: "Visual elements are ambiguous in text. Offering a companion diagram gives the user the option to request clarity at low cost."

Non-retrievable. Optional — skip if design has no visual elements.
