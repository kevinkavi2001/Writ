# Technique: Inline self-review

## Checklist

- [ ] No placeholders (TBD, TODO, "similar to above", vague phrases)
- [ ] Internal consistency (types match across tasks, functions named the same way referenced)
- [ ] Scope matches spec (no silent scope creep, no missing spec items)
- [ ] Unambiguous (each step has exactly one interpretation)

## Time budget

~30 seconds. Not a replacement for external review on large PRs, but eliminates the cheap defect class before presenting.
