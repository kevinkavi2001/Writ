rule_id: ENF-PROC-WORKTREE-001
domain: process
severity: high
scope: task
trigger: "When the agent runs git worktree add <path> where <path> is inside the repo tree and is not listed in .gitignore."
statement: "Project-local worktree directories must be gitignored. Bash gate denies 'git worktree add' commands targeting non-ignored repo-local paths."
violation: "Agent runs 'git worktree add ./work_trees/feature-x' without adding './work_trees/' to .gitignore. Gate denies the Bash call."
pass_example: "Agent confirms .gitignore contains '.worktrees/' or equivalent, then runs 'git worktree add .worktrees/feature-x'. Gate permits."
enforcement: "writ-worktree-safety.sh on PreToolUse Bash matching 'git worktree add': parse target path, check .gitignore, deny if project-local and not ignored."
rationale: "Non-ignored project-local worktrees pollute the main branch's working tree and cause accidental commits. The safety check is absolute, not advisory."
