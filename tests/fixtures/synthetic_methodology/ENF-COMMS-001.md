rule_id: ENF-COMMS-001
domain: communication
severity: high
scope: session
trigger: "Any time the agent responds to code review, user correction, or technical evaluation input, and the response text contains a forbidden phrase from FRB-COMMS-001 or FRB-COMMS-002."
statement: "Advisory rule: agent responses must not contain performative agreement or unverified success claims. Lexical match against FRB-COMMS forbidden_phrases surfaces violation to friction log."
violation: "Agent responds 'You're absolutely right! Great point!' to reviewer feedback. Matches FRB-COMMS-001 forbidden_phrases. Friction-log records ENF-COMMS-001 violation."
pass_example: "Agent responds 'Let me verify that claim against the codebase. Running the check... Output: <quote>. Based on that, your point holds.' No forbidden phrase. No violation."
enforcement: "Advisory only — post-response pattern match. No pre-response deny (blocking every turn on forbidden-phrase detection would cause false positives). Violations collected for Phase 5 review."
rationale: "Lexical phrase match has false-positive risk in legitimate contexts (e.g., paraphrase of reviewer's argument). Blocking would create friction; advisory+telemetry lets Phase 5 rubric-refine the blocklist."
