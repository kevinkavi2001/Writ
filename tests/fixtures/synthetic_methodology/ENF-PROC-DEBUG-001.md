domain: process
severity: high
scope: task
trigger: "When the agent is actively debugging (session.mode == 'debug') and proposes a fix without documented root-cause evidence."
statement: "Advisory rule: fixes during debug mode should cite root-cause evidence in the same response. No mechanical enforcement path — advisory because lexical detection of 'evidence' is unreliable."
violation: "Agent in debug mode says 'let me try changing X' without having explained why X is the cause. Advisory warning surfaced to agent in response bundle."
pass_example: "Agent in debug mode says 'The failure appears at line 42 when request.body is empty. Fix: validate body before accessing. Evidence: traceback shows KeyError at line 42.' Advisory passes."
enforcement: "Advisory only — surfaced as part of debug-mode always-on bundle. No deny condition. Friction-logged when agent claims success on fix without evidence."
rationale: "Symptom-patching is the canonical debug-mode failure. Forcing evidence-cite discipline reduces it, but no reliable lexical detector exists for 'is this evidence?' so the rule stays advisory."
