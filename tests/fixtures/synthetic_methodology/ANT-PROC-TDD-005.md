trigger: "When the agent writes production code first and adds tests afterward (test-after), or rationalizes that 'tests after achieve the same purpose.'"
statement: "Test-after: tests written after code become confirmations of what was built, not specifications of what should be built. They pass trivially and miss design-level errors."
rationale: "Test-first forces clear interface design before implementation. Test-after forces tests to accommodate whatever got implemented. The former catches design errors; the latter ratifies them."

# Anti-pattern: Test after implementation

## The rationalizations

- "I already manually tested it."
- "Tests after achieve the same purpose."
- "Deleting X hours of work to restart is wasteful."
- "The code works, the tests will just confirm."

## The counter

Delete the code. Write the test first. Watch it fail. Then write the code. No exceptions for sunk cost.
