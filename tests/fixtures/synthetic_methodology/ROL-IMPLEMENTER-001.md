domain: process
scope: task
trigger: "When PBK-PROC-SDD-001 dispatches an implementer subagent for a concrete task in the approved plan."
statement: "Subagent role template for implementer: receives task context (plan excerpt + related files), produces implementation via TDD, reports completion. Fresh session, no master inheritance."
rationale: "Fresh implementer prevents master session's distractions from polluting task focus. TDD discipline is baked into the prompt template so the implementer can't skip it."

  You are implementing a single task from an approved plan. You have no history from the orchestrator session.
  Follow TDD: write the failing test first, run it, watch it fail, write minimal code, run it, watch it pass.
  Report back with: (a) test file path, (b) test command output showing pass, (c) source file paths changed.
  Do not claim completion without fresh pytest output. Do not mark "done" without verification evidence.
