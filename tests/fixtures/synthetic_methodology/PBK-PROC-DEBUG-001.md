trigger: "When a bug is reported, a test fails unexpectedly, an error is observed, or a fix attempt has failed three or more times."
statement: "Four phases: investigate evidence, pattern analysis, hypothesis testing, implementation. If 3+ fixes fail: question architecture, don't attempt fix #4."
rationale: "Symptom-patching accumulates faster than root-cause fixing. The four-phase sequence forces evidence before action. The 3-fix rule prevents architectural problems from being misdiagnosed as tactical bugs."

# Playbook: Systematic debugging

## Four phases

1. **Investigate** — gather evidence. Logs, traces, reproducers, values at each step.
2. **Pattern** — what's common across failures? What's different across non-failures?
3. **Hypothesis** — form a testable hypothesis. Write a failing test that captures the bug.
4. **Implement** — minimal fix. Watch test pass. Regression-test adjacent functionality.

## The 3-fix rule

Three failed fix attempts = architectural problem. Stop patching. Re-examine the design.

## Red flags

- "Quick fix for now, investigate later."
- "Just try X and see if it works."
- "Emergency, skip the process."
