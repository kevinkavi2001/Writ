domain: process
severity: high
scope: task
trigger: "When a plan.md artifact is written and contains placeholder content (TBD, TODO, 'similar to N') or fails structural quality gate."
statement: "plan.md artifacts must contain no placeholder content, exact file paths, and complete code blocks. Gate 5 Tier 1 (structural) denies writes with placeholder text in any plan section."
violation: "plan.md contains 'Step 5: implement appropriate error handling, similar to Step 3.' Gate 5 Tier 1 matches 'appropriate' and 'similar to' in the blocklist, denies the write, logs to friction log."
pass_example: "plan.md Step 5: 'In src/api.py line 42, wrap the fetch() call in try/except OrderNotFoundError, log the error with order_id context, re-raise.' Concrete path, concrete change, concrete reasoning. Gate passes."
enforcement: "Gate 5 Tier 1 via validate-exit-plan.sh: lexical match against placeholder blocklist (TBD, TODO, fill in, appropriate, similar to, as needed, placeholder). Gate 5 Tier 2 via Haiku judge rubric on PostToolUse for semantic-level boilerplate."
rationale: "Placeholder plans transfer design decisions to the implementer as interpretation. They are the canonical failure mode of AI-generated planning."
