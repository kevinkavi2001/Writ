statement: "Evaluate feedback technically before implementing. Verify against the codebase. Ask clarification on unclear items. Never respond with performative agreement."
rationale: "Performative agreement collapses the boundary between 'I heard you' and 'I agree.' Without technical verification, the agent implements things that may be wrong, making the review a liability rather than a check."

# Skill: Receive code review

## Never-phrases

See `FRB-COMMS-001`. Gratitude, agreement, or implementation-intent BEFORE verification are all forbidden.

## The workflow

1. Read each item.
2. For each: verify against the codebase. Is the reviewer correct? Is there something they missed?
3. If unclear: ask for clarification. Don't implement until understood.
4. If disagree: push back with reasoning, not defensiveness.
5. Only then implement. Test each change individually.

## Anti-pattern

Batch implementation of all review items without testing each. If any is wrong, all become suspect.
