# Playbook: TDD

## The cycle

1. **RED** — write the smallest failing test that captures the next behavior. Watch it fail.
2. **GREEN** — write the minimal code that makes it pass. No more, no less.
3. **REFACTOR** — clean up. Both test and code. Tests still pass.
4. Repeat.

## Hard rules

- No production code before a failing test exists.
- If you wrote code before a test: delete the code. Start over. No exceptions.
- If a test passes on first run: see `ANT-PROC-TDD-001`.

TDD integrates with `SKL-PROC-PLAN-001` (test-per-task in plan), `PBK-PROC-DEBUG-001` (failing test before fix in Phase 4), `PBK-PROC-SDD-001` (implementer does TDD per task).
