domain: process
severity: critical
scope: session
trigger: "When the agent claims success based on a subagent's reported success, without running the verification command itself."
statement: "Trusting subagent success reports: the implementer subagent says 'done'; the agent marks task complete without fresh verification. Subagent was wrong; bug ships."
rationale: "Subagents can be wrong. Their confidence is not evidence. The verification discipline exists precisely because confidence-as-evidence is the canonical agentic-coding failure mode."

# Anti-pattern: Trust subagent success reports

## Counter

Run the verification command yourself, in this message. Subagent reports are hypotheses, not evidence. Fresh run is evidence.
