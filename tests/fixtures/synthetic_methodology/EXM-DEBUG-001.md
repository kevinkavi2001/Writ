trigger: "User requests an example of applying PBK-PROC-DEBUG-001 four-phase process to a multi-component bug."
statement: "Walk-through of backward root-cause tracing on a totals-collector race condition that manifests as intermittent wrong discount totals."
rationale: "Multi-component bugs are the hardest to debug; a worked example shows phase-by-phase evidence gathering, hypothesis, test-first fix."

title: "Debugging a totals-collector race"
before: "Intermittent: about 1 in 50 cart checkouts produces a discount that's double the expected value. Not reproducible locally under single-user load."
applied_skill: PBK-PROC-DEBUG-001
result: "Phase 1: gathered evidence (MySQL binlog showed duplicate discount rows). Phase 2: pattern analysis (all failures had concurrent cart updates in same second). Phase 3: hypothesis (race in totals collector's totals table write). Phase 4: wrote failing test simulating concurrent update, minimal fix added SELECT FOR UPDATE, test passes."
