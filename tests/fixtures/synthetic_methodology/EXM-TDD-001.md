trigger: "User requests an example of applying PBK-PROC-TDD-001 to a concrete bug fix."
statement: "Concrete walk-through of RED-GREEN-REFACTOR applied to the 'empty request body' bug. Shows the exact test written, the failure output, the minimal fix, the passing output."
rationale: "Worked examples anchor abstract methodology in specific commands and outputs. The TDD skill is easier to apply after seeing a full cycle executed."

# Worked example: TDD applied to empty-body bug

Non-retrievable via standard pipeline. Surfaces when a user explicitly asks for an example of TDD application, via explicit lookup.
