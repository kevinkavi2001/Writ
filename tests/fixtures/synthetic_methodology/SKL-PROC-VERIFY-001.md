trigger: "Any time the agent is about to claim an implementation is complete, a test passes, a build succeeds, or any success condition holds."
statement: "No completion claim without fresh verification evidence. Run the command in this message. Read the output. Then claim — only then."
rationale: "Claims without evidence are the canonical failure mode that destroys trust with users. A single false 'done' requires triple the recovery effort of evidence-first claims."

# Skill: Verify before completion

## The gate function

1. Identify the verification command.
2. Run it (fresh, in this message).
3. Read the output.
4. Then claim — and state the claim with the evidence inline.

## Red flags

- "Should", "probably", "seems to"
- Claiming success before running the command
- Trusting subagent success reports without verifying
- Partial verification (linter but not build; unit but not integration)

## Forbidden phrases

See `FRB-COMMS-002` for the always-on phrase blocklist. Examples: "Should work now", "Looks good", "I'm confident this passes."
