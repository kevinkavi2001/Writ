"""Regression floors for retrieval-quality gate metrics.

Canonical source of truth for the MRR@5 ambiguous-set floor and the
hit-rate floor across the full ground-truth corpus. Both
``benchmarks/bench_targets.py`` and ``tests/test_graph_proximity.py``
import from this module; the constants must not be duplicated
elsewhere.

The floor is the value below which the build fails. It is not a
target. Targets (the value we would prefer to recover toward) are
not encoded here; raise the floor when measurement supports it.

Phase-by-phase history of the floor walking down as the corpus grew
from 72 to 276 rules (preserved verbatim from the original site at
``tests/test_graph_proximity.py:32-61`` before consolidation):

                                   (was 0.7576). Floor unchanged at
                                   0.45 / 0.75 -- the new measurement
                                   has substantial headroom, but with
                                   only 19 queries a single hit/miss
                                   flip moves MRR by ~5pp, so raising

                                   can be characterized at the

    0.45 / 0.75     2026-05-15     Item 1b measurement, no floor change:

                                   in Item 1a) found that SEC-DATA-PII-002
                                   is the correct answer for the query
                                   "customer data is leaking through
                                   the GraphQL API" but its trigger /
                                   statement / rationale text did not
                                   contain "GraphQL", "customer",
                                   "leak", or "PII" -- the BM25 +
                                   vector ranker correctly assigned
                                   the query to rules with stronger
                                   keyword overlap (SEC-RATE-API-001,
                                   which explicitly lists "REST, GraphQL,
                                   RPC" in its trigger). Fix was to the
                                   corpus content, not the retrieval
                                   algorithm: added "REST or GraphQL"
                                   and "customer" to the trigger, "leaks
                                   PII and internal state" to the
                                   statement, and "customer-data leaks"
                                   plus "PII exposure on REST and GraphQL
                                   endpoints" to the rationale. These
                                   are genuine clarifications, not
                                   artificial keyword injection; the
                                   rule should match REST and GraphQL
                                   PII concerns equally and the prior

Each public-rulebook sub-phase diluted the ambiguous-set MRR / hit
rate. After full Phase 1-5 expansion (276 rules / 30 mandatory) and
Phase 6 ground-truth refresh, floors stabilized at 0.45 / 0.75
against the expanded corpus and 165-query ground truth.

Open question (2026-05-13). Re-measurement against the 276-rule
corpus on a current daemon produced MRR@5 = 0.4886 (passes 0.45) and
hit-rate = 0.7576 (passes 0.75 by 0.0076). The floor walk was not
covering for a small-corpus measurement artifact -- the 19 ambiguous
queries are stable, but ranking against them genuinely weakened as
the corpus grew. The v1.1.0 work tracks expanding the ambiguous set
toward ~70 queries (proportional to the 3.8x corpus growth) and
recovering toward the pre-expansion floor.

When raising a floor here, also append a new row to the history
table above. The history is append-only; do not delete prior rows
even when superseded.
