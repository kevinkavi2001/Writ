    Pre-2026-05-09 this hook had inline migration logic gated on
    `if count == 0`. That gate skipped re-migration whenever ANY test
    re-loaded core rules (most do), leaving methodology nodes
    (Skill / Playbook / etc.) missing post-suite -- the symptom was
    `/always-on?mode=work` returning empty after `pytest -q`.

    New approach: shell out to scripts/migrate.py unconditionally.
    The script is MERGE-only (idempotent), runs in <2s, and is the
    canonical migration path used in production. Single source of
    truth -- the inline duplicate is gone.
