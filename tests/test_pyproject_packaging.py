"""pyproject.toml packaging contract.

PSR-008 Finding 3 surfaced that `python3 -m writ.cli` fails outside the
writ skill's .venv (ModuleNotFoundError). The fix has two layers:

1. `bin/writ` shim (commit 08b3cff) -- works without pip install
2. `pip install -e .` from this repo -- creates `.venv/bin/writ`
   console_script via the [project.scripts] entry in pyproject.toml

This test pins the pyproject.toml shape so a future regression that
removes the entry_point or breaks package discovery is caught at lint
time, BEFORE someone tries `pip install` and discovers the shim is
the only path.
