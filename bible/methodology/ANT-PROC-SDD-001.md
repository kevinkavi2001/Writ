domain: process
severity: high
scope: task
trigger: "When subagent-driven development is invoked and reviewers are dispatched in wrong order (code-quality before spec-compliance) or spec review is skipped entirely."
statement: "Wrong review order: running code-quality review before spec-compliance review wastes effort polishing code that implements the wrong spec."
rationale: "Spec-compliance is the coarser filter — it catches 'built the wrong thing.' Code-quality is the finer filter — it polishes 'built the right thing.' Inverting the order polishes wrongness."

# Anti-pattern: Wrong review order in SDD

## Counter

Spec compliance first, always. If spec fails: back to implementer. Only when spec passes does code-quality review run. See `PBK-PROC-SDD-001`.
