rule_id: ENF-PROC-VERIFY-001
domain: process
severity: critical
scope: session
trigger: "When the agent attempts to mark a TodoWrite item complete, or when the session's Stop hook fires and completion claims exist without verification evidence."
statement: "Completion claims require fresh verification evidence in the same message. TodoWrite completion denied without verification_evidence set in session state."
violation: "Agent marks todo 'implement fetch()' as completed in TodoWrite without running pytest in the current message. Gate denies. Friction log records 'gate_denied: ENF-PROC-VERIFY-001'."
pass_example: "Agent runs pytest tests/test_api.py, output shows '1 passed', quotes the output, then TodoWrite marks todo completed with verification_evidence='pytest tests/test_api.py: 1 passed'."
enforcement: "writ-verify-before-claim.sh on PreToolUse TodoWrite + Stop: checks session.verification_evidence for the claimed item. Deny if missing or stale."
rationale: "Completion claims without evidence erode user trust. Mechanical enforcement prevents the confidence-as-evidence failure mode."
