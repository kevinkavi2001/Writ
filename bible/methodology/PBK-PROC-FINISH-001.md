trigger: "When development work on a branch is complete (tests pass) and must be wrapped up via merge, PR, keep-as-is, or discard."
statement: "Verify tests pass. Present exactly 4 options: (1) merge locally + cleanup, (2) push + create PR, (3) keep as-is, (4) discard (requires typed 'discard' confirmation)."
rationale: "A fixed option set eliminates novel-path improvisation at finish time. The typed-confirmation requirement on discard prevents accidental work loss."

# Playbook: Finish a development branch

## Precondition

Tests pass. If not, show failures and STOP — no option presentation.

## The 4 options

1. **Merge locally** — merge to base, delete worktree, delete branch.
2. **Push and create PR** — push, open PR, leave worktree intact.
3. **Keep as-is** — no action, user continues later.
4. **Discard** — requires typed `discard`, deletes branch and worktree.

## Never offer a 5th option

Custom merge workflows are ANT-PROC-FINISH territory. Present the 4 options exactly.
