rule_id: ENF-PROC-SDD-001
domain: process
severity: high
scope: task
trigger: "When subagent-driven development is active and reviewers are dispatched out of order (code-quality before spec-compliance, or either review skipped)."
statement: "Spec-compliance review must complete before code-quality review starts. Out-of-order dispatch denied by gate."
violation: "Agent dispatches ROL-CODE-REVIEWER-001 before ROL-SPEC-REVIEWER-001 has returned findings. Gate denies the Task dispatch."
pass_example: "Agent dispatches ROL-SPEC-REVIEWER-001, waits for findings, resolves any, then dispatches ROL-CODE-REVIEWER-001. Gate permits."
enforcement: "writ-sdd-review-order.sh on PreToolUse Task: checks session.review_ordering_state for the current task. Denies if code-reviewer dispatched before spec-reviewer has completed."
rationale: "Spec-first catches wrong-thing-built. Polishing wrong code is wasted work."
