node_type: Skill
domain: process
severity: high
scope: task
trigger: "When a user's approved design must be converted into an implementation plan with concrete steps, file paths, and complete code per step."
statement: "Write bite-sized implementation plans with exact file paths, complete code blocks, exact commands with expected output. Never use placeholders (TBD, TODO, 'similar to task N', 'fill in later')."
rationale: "Placeholder-laden plans transfer the design decision to the implementer's interpretation. Complete plans are reproducible and auditable; placeholder plans are aspirational fiction."
