node_type: AntiPattern
domain: process
severity: high
scope: task
trigger: "When a plan contains placeholder content (TBD, TODO, 'similar to task N', 'implement appropriate error handling', 'write tests for above')."
statement: "Placeholder content in plans: each placeholder is a deferred design decision transferred to the implementer as interpretation. Non-reproducible plans."
rationale: "The plan is a contract between design and implementation. Placeholders break the contract — they force the implementer to guess. Guesses drift from user intent."
