# Rule: Brainstorm before code (mandatory in Work mode)

## Statement

The agent must present a design and receive explicit user approval before any code-producing tool call executes in Work mode. No exceptions for task simplicity. Gate applies universally within Work mode; non-work modes skip this enforcement per absorption plan Section 0.4 decision 1.

## Violation (bad)

Agent in Work mode, user request: "refactor this function to use async."

```
Write(src/api.py, "async def fetch(url): ...")
```

No design presented. No approval. Write denied by gate. Friction log records `gate_denied: ENF-PROC-BRAIN-001, attempt=write, approval_state=missing`.

## Pass (good)

Agent in Work mode, user request: "refactor this function to use async."

```
Present design:
Option A: convert fetch() to async, update all callers (3 sites).
Option B: add an async wrapper, leave sync version as fallback.
Option C: async-only, break the sync callers — requires caller refactor.

Trade-offs: A is clean but risky; B is safe but doubles surface area; C is aggressive.

My recommendation: A. Confirm, or say which option you prefer.

Wait for user: "approved - go with A."

Then: Write(src/api.py, ...)
```

## Enforcement path

`.claude/hooks/validate-exit-plan.sh` + `writ-session.py` phase state machine. The hook checks `session.mode == "work"` AND `session.design_approved == true` before any code-producing tool call. Both conditions required.
