domain: process
severity: high
scope: task
trigger: "When a test calls private/internal methods (e.g., Python `_name` prefix, or class-private fields exposed only for test access)."
statement: "Test-only methods: production code gains a public surface that exists only so tests can reach internal state. The test is then coupled to implementation, not behavior."
rationale: "Tests that reach internals break on refactor even when behavior is unchanged. A test that tests behavior should not care how the behavior is produced internally."

# Anti-pattern: Test-only methods

## The smell

Public method, field, or getter added "just so tests can verify X." Removed in refactor → tests break, production unaffected.

## Counter

Test through the public interface. If behavior is hard to reach through public methods, the public interface is missing something the user of the class also needs — not just the test.
