trigger: "Ninth and final phase of PBK-PROC-BRAIN-001. Fires after design is presented."
statement: "Wait for explicit user approval. Do not advance to implementation. Silence is not approval. Maybe is not approval. 'Sounds good' is not approval. Only an explicit approval word advances."
rationale: "The approval gate is the load-bearing control that prevents premature implementation. Any weakening (inferring approval from tone, silence, or casual phrasing) collapses the whole discipline."

Non-retrievable. Bundle-only. Gates advancement to implementation — see `ENF-PROC-BRAIN-001` for mechanical enforcement.
