rule_id: META-AUTH-002
domain: meta-authoring
severity: high
scope: task
trigger: "When the agent authors a new Writ Skill, Playbook, or Technique and is about to mark it ready for use without running a pressure test against the rule's target behavior."
statement: "Skills must pass a pressure test before deployment: apply the baseline scenario, confirm RED (agent violates), write or refine the skill, re-run, confirm GREEN (agent complies). No skill ships without RED-GREEN-REFACTOR applied to itself."
violation: "Agent authors a new skill SKL-PROC-FOO-001 and commits without running pressure-test. Advisory warning surfaced during writ add; friction-logged."
pass_example: "Agent authors draft skill, runs writ test-pressure --scenario PSC-FOO-001, confirms agent violates the rule (RED), refines skill text, re-runs, confirms agent now complies (GREEN). Then commits."
enforcement: "writ add advisory check: warns if a new SKL-/PBK-/TEC-/ENF- node is added without a linked PressureScenario. Does not block."
rationale: "Untested skills deploy with unknown effectiveness. The RED-GREEN-REFACTOR discipline that applies to code also applies to methodology content."
