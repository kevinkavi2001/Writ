# Rationalization: "This task is obviously simple"

Non-retrievable node. Surfaces only via `ATTACHED_TO` edge during Stage 4 bundle expansion when `ENF-PROC-BRAIN-001` or `SKL-PROC-BRAIN-001` is the primary retrieval hit.

## The thought

"This task is obviously simple."

## The counter

Every project goes through brainstorm. "Obvious" is your read, not the user's. The "too simple" framing is the canonical anti-pattern named in the source skill.

## Inline vs graph representation

Per schema proposal rationalization-representation section: this standalone graph node is canonical. The inline `rationalization_counters` field on `ENF-PROC-BRAIN-001` is a render convenience populated by ingest. On divergence, this node wins.
