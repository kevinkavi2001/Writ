trigger: "When an approved implementation plan exists and must be executed task-by-task in a separate session, with per-task verification."
statement: "Load the plan, review it for gaps, execute tasks in order, verify each before the next. On blocker: STOP and ask — never work around."
rationale: "Execution without per-task verification silently accumulates defects. Stopping on blockers prevents partial-completion states that are expensive to unwind."

# Skill: Execute an approved plan

## Load and review

Read the entire plan before starting. If gaps exist (undefined types, missing files, contradictions), STOP and ask — do not fill in.

## Execute in order

One task at a time. Verify each task's success criteria before moving to the next.

## On blocker

STOP and ask the user. Do not improvise a workaround. Blockers are design-level, not implementation-level.
