domain: process
severity: high
scope: task
trigger: "When the agent attempts multiple fixes simultaneously, or attempts a fourth fix after three have failed on the same bug."
statement: "Multiple fixes at once or one-more-fix-attempt: attempting simultaneous changes makes it impossible to attribute cause; attempting a fourth fix after three failures means the architecture is wrong, not the patch."
rationale: "Parallel changes destroy the ability to attribute cause. Repeated fix attempts without new hypotheses indicate the bug model is wrong — the bug is architectural, not tactical."

# Anti-pattern: Multiple fixes / fourth-fix

## Counter

One change at a time. Verify each. If three fixes failed: stop. Re-examine the architecture. The bug is bigger than a patch.
