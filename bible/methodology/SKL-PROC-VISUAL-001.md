statement: "Offer a visual companion artifact (diagram, mockup, sketch) as a separate message, not combined with clarifying questions. The offer is a yes/no question to the user."
rationale: "Combining visual offers with clarifying questions overloads the user's response. Separating them lets the user answer one at a time and produces a cleaner design artifact."

# Skill: Offer visual companion

## When to offer

Design contains spatial, layout, UI, state-machine, or data-flow elements. Text alone would be ambiguous or verbose.

## How to offer

Separate message. Simple binary: "This design has visual elements. Would a diagram help?" Do not bundle with clarifying questions.

## What counts

ASCII diagrams, structured tables, simple sketches embedded in response, or deferrable "I'll produce a mermaid diagram if useful."
