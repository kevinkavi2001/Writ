domain: process
severity: critical
scope: task
trigger: "In Work mode: when a Write or Edit to a production source file is attempted without a corresponding test file containing assertions."
statement: "Production code requires a failing test before implementation. Gate denies Write/Edit to src/** paths without corresponding tests/** file containing lexical test markers."
violation: "Agent in Work mode attempts Write(src/api.py, 'def fetch(url): ...') without tests/test_api.py existing or containing assertions. Gate denies. Friction log records 'gate_denied: ENF-PROC-TDD-001'."
pass_example: "Agent writes tests/test_api.py with test_fetch_returns_json (containing assert statement), runs pytest (fails as expected — function doesn't exist), then Write(src/api.py, 'def fetch(url): ...'). Gate permits because test exists."
enforcement: "validate-test-file.sh: on PreToolUse Write matching src/**/*.{py,js,ts,php}, find corresponding test file, check for lexical assertion markers (assert|expect|should|test_). Deny if missing."
rationale: "Test-first discipline is what the skill teaches. Mechanical enforcement makes the discipline impossible to rationalize around."

# Rule: Test first (mandatory in Work mode)

Enforcement: `validate-test-file.sh`. Bypass: `session.mode == "prototype"` only.
