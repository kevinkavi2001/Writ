trigger: "First phase of PBK-PROC-BRAIN-001. Fires when the playbook starts execution."
statement: "Understand the user's intent by restating their goal in your own words and confirming the restatement."
rationale: "Premature approach generation is a leading cause of brainstorm-fail. Restating the user's goal forces the agent to notice ambiguities before committing to an approach, and surfaces disagreements early when they are cheap to correct."

  Restate the user's goal in your own words. Confirm the restatement with the user before proceeding to constraint clarification. If the user corrects the restatement, accept the correction and re-confirm — do not proceed until the restatement matches the user's intent.

# Phase 1: Understand intent

Non-retrievable structural node. Surfaces only via `CONTAINS` edge traversal from `PBK-PROC-BRAIN-001`.

## What this phase does

Restate the user's goal in your own words. Confirm the restatement. If corrected, accept correction and re-confirm.

## Why first

Everything downstream (approaches, trade-offs, design) depends on a correct understanding of intent. Getting intent wrong cheap to fix at Phase 1, expensive at Phase 8.

## Advance criterion

User affirms the restatement (e.g., "yes, that's right" or equivalent). Silence or ambiguity is not affirmation — ask again.
