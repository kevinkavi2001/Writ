# Skill: Dispatch parallel agents

## Decision tree

- Multiple tasks? → Are they independent? → Yes: dispatch in parallel / No: dispatch sequentially or as a single agent.
- Tasks share state? → Sequential.
- Tasks produce outputs the next task consumes? → Sequential.
- Tasks touch disjoint problem domains with no shared state? → Parallel.

## One agent per problem domain

Not "one agent to fix all failing tests" (broad scope). Instead: "one agent per failing test subsystem with its own problem domain."

## Explicit output expectations

Each dispatched agent gets a prompt naming exactly what output structure to return (JSON shape, file paths, or finding format). Vague outputs waste parallelism.
