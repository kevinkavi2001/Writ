severity: high
scope: task
trigger: "When the agent authors a new Writ Skill, Playbook, or Technique node, and is about to populate the trigger or description field."
statement: "The trigger field of a node must describe WHEN the node should activate, not WHAT the node does. Description-as-workflow-summary causes Claude to follow descriptions instead of reading skill bodies, fragmenting methodology retrieval at scale."
violation: "New skill authored with trigger: 'This skill performs systematic debugging by gathering evidence, forming hypotheses, testing them, and implementing fixes in four phases.' Field describes what; agent sees the summary at retrieval and skips the body. Authoring-gate warns on action verbs in trigger text."
pass_example: "New skill authored with trigger: 'When a bug is reported, a test fails, an error is observed, or the same fix attempt has failed three times.' Field describes when; agent retrieves the node and reads the body for the how. Authoring-gate passes."
enforcement: "writ add and writ edit lint the trigger field, warn on action verbs (does, performs, executes) that indicate workflow-summary rather than triggering-condition content."
rationale: "At scale (>30 skills), agent-side selection of which skill to use becomes the bottleneck. If descriptions summarize workflow, the agent has enough information to act without reading the body — and it acts on the summary, which is incomplete. Triggering-conditions descriptions force the agent to the body, where the actual methodology lives."

# Rule: Description field is a trigger predicate, not a workflow summary

## Statement

A skill/playbook/technique's `trigger` field answers WHEN the node applies, not WHAT the node does. The WHAT lives in the body (body is indexed at 0.5× weight in Stage 2 BM25 per plan Section 3.2; the trigger is the primary retrieval surface).

## Violation (bad)

```yaml
---
skill_id: SKL-PROC-DEBUG-001
trigger: "This skill performs systematic debugging by gathering evidence, forming hypotheses, testing them, and implementing fixes in four phases."
---
```

Describes what the skill does. Claude sees it, thinks "got it," and skips the body.

## Pass (good)

```yaml
---
skill_id: SKL-PROC-DEBUG-001
trigger: "When a bug is reported, a test fails, an error is observed, or the same fix attempt has failed three times."
---
```

Names the conditions under which the skill should fire. Claude retrieves and reads the body for the how.
