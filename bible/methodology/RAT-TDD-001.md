trigger: "When the agent has written production code and is considering whether to add tests after the fact."
statement: "'I already manually tested it, writing unit tests later is the same thing.' The counter: manual tests don't regress. A committed test does. Manual testing is not substitutable."
rationale: "The most common TDD bypass. Manual testing gives one data point; unit tests give permanent regression coverage. Conflating them is the canonical rationalization that erodes the test-first discipline."
