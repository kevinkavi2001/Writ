trigger: "When the agent is about to claim completion and has recent (but not fresh) verification evidence in session memory."
statement: "'I ran the tests earlier in this session, the claim is fine.' The counter: stale evidence. Code has potentially changed since. Run fresh in this message."
rationale: "Session-stale evidence is a common trap. Earlier runs attest to an earlier state. Fresh runs attest to the current state. Only fresh runs back a current claim."
