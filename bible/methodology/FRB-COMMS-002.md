domain: communication
severity: critical
scope: session
trigger: "Any time the agent is about to state that something works, passes, is complete, or succeeds."
statement: "Unverified success claim phrases are forbidden. They substitute confidence for evidence. The agent must never utter them without inline verification output."
rationale: "Claims without evidence erode trust with users. One false 'done' requires three recoveries. The discipline makes confidence-as-evidence syntactically impossible."

# Forbidden: Unverified success claims

## Why these are forbidden

"Should", "probably", "looks good" — each is an admission that verification did not happen. The discipline inverts: state the evidence first, then the claim derives from it. Claims that cannot trace to evidence are unstated.

## What to say instead

See `what_to_say_instead` in front-matter.
