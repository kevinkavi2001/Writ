# Skill: Brainstorm before writing code

Natural language: before any implementation, you must present a design and receive user approval. This skill names the discipline, the failure modes, and the counter-thoughts.

## When this applies

Any new feature request. Any behavior change. Any refactor. Any investigation that would result in code changes. The skill applies regardless of perceived task size; "simple" is a property of how the agent feels, not of how the user will evaluate the outcome.

## Red flag thoughts (indicators of violation)

- "This is too simple to need a design."
- "I've brainstormed enough, let me start coding."
- "The user already described what they want, I can skip the design."
- "They'll tell me if I'm wrong once I show them the code."

## Hard gate

Do not invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until a design has been presented AND the user has approved it. This is mechanical, not advisory.
