[WRIT QUALITY-JUDGE] You just wrote a plan: $FILE
Before marking any todo item for this task as completed, self-review this plan
and POST your judgment to the session endpoint.

Rubric (plan Section 15.4):
  Score each '## <section>' 0-5 on whether it contains substantive content
  SPECIFIC to the task, vs generic boilerplate that could be pasted into any plan.
  - Specific: names concrete files, verifiable success criteria, realistic steps
  - Generic: placeholder-level content that structurally exists but conveys
    no task-specific information
  Overall score = the LOWEST scoring section. Score ≥ 3 is required.

Post the judgment:
  curl -sX POST http://localhost:8765/session/$SESSION_ID/quality-judgment \\
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
    -d '{"artifact_path": "$FILE", "score": <0-5>, "failing_section": "<name or null>", "rationale": "<one sentence>"}'

If score < 3: name the failing section and what specific change raises it to
3+, fix the plan, re-self-review, re-post. Do NOT mark the todo completed
until a score ≥ 3 is recorded (or --override-quality-judge is used; overrides
beyond 3 per session escalate to pressure audit per Section 0.4 decision 4).

Rubric (plan Section 15.5):
  - Alternatives Considered: names real alternatives (not straw-men)
  - Constraints: real constraints (not generic platitudes)
  - Risks: actionable risks with plausible mitigations

Overall score = the lowest across the three areas. Score ≥ 3 required.

Rubric (plan Section 15.6):
  Do the assertions test real behavior (call production code, verify outputs
  against expectations), or do they test mocks / trivially-true conditions?
  Reference the 5 TDD anti-patterns (ANT-PROC-TDD-001 through ANT-PROC-TDD-005).
