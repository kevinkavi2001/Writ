[Writ: context compacted]
Until the next compaction, treat any pre-compact verification output (test counts,
"passing" claims, file reads) as second-hand evidence.

If asked "is it working?" / "is it done?" / "did it pass?":
  1. Re-run the relevant verification (tests, lint, typecheck, smoke command) FIRST.
  2. If the re-run is BLOCKED (tool rejection, permission denied, env unavailable):
       STOP. Do NOT answer "yes", "passing", or "should be working".
       Respond instead: "Re-verification was blocked by [reason]. I cannot confirm
       post-compact. Pre-compact context says X but I have no fresh evidence.
       Want me to verify another way?"
  3. Only answer affirmatively with fresh test/lint output cited inline.

Saying "yes" / "passing" / "all good" without fresh evidence is a forbidden response
in this state. Recalled output is not fresh evidence.
