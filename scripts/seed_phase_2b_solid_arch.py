"""Phase 2B of the public rulebook expansion: SOLID + Architecture.

Seeds 24 new SOLID-* and ARCH-* rules into Neo4j (0 mandatory) and renames
3 legacy ARCH-* rules to align with public-rulebook IDs:

  ARCH-ORG-001 -> ARCH-LAYER-001  (layer boundaries enforced)
  ARCH-EXT-001 -> SOLID-OCP-001   (extension via composition)
  ARCH-DI-001  -> SOLID-DIP-002   (constructor injection of abstractions)

ARCH-COMP-001 (inheritance depth <= 2) and ARCH-PE-* / ARCH-RES-*
project-specific rules are retained as Writ extensions.

Idempotent. Re-runs MERGE existing rules with the same rule_id.

Per RULEBOOK-AUDIT.md and out-of-the-box-rules.md sections 4, 5.
